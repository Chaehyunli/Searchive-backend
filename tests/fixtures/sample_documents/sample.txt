Machine Learning and Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Guide

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on training algorithms to learn from data. Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Training models with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
4. Training Data: Dataset used to train machine learning models
5. Feature Engineering: Process of selecting and transforming variables

Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

Applications:
- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Language Translation
- Sentiment Analysis
- Recommendation Systems

The future of AI depends heavily on advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies.
